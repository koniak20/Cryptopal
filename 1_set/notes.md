Built-in types : BYTES && BYTEARRAY

bytes - immutable just as strings ( 0 <= x <= 256)

> Can convert bytes to list of int!

Function that I'm confused about

- fromhex
	strings hex values-> bytes
- hex
	bytes -> strings hex values
- b64encode
	bytes -> bytes	
- b64decode
	bytes -> bytes	
- decode
	bytes -> strings
- encode
	strings -> bytes
